## Key Features

### 1. Student manipulation

The user can `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `grade` and `graduate` students.

### 2. Group manipulation

The user can `add`, `delete` and `edit` groups.

### 3. Faculty manipulation

The user can `add`, `delete` and `edit` faculties.

### 4. GUI

Handy and intuitive form-based GUI to handle inputs and operations.

### 5. Batch loading/graduating

The user can use a text file to load or graduate students in batch. Format examples can be found in the `/src/org/lumijiez/data/` package.

### 6. Logging system

The app logs all user operations together with a time stamp. It created a text log file at each program startup, and includes the startup time in the filename.

### 7. Serialization

The app serializes your data once you exit so you don't have to input everything again once you restart the program.
